# Hacking World of Warcraft: Part Two - Packet Playtime! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

Welcome back, If you havenâ€™t already checked out Part One of this series, I highly recommend diving into it here: [Part One: Hacking World of Warcraft](https://github.com/MrFade321/Hacking_World_of_Warcraft).

In our last post, I successfully hooked into our `NetSend` function and read out our Opcode `WORD` value. This little victory allowed us to compare the Opcode against the definitions over at Trinity Core. You can check that out [here](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/blob/master/src/server/game/Server/Protocol/Opcodes.h).

Now, In this post, weâ€™re going to start having some serious fun with packets and hopefully build something that makes packet manipulation easy and accessible for everyone!

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal 

Today, our mission is to create a user-friendly program for editing and managing packets. The idea is to make it so straightforward that anyone can poke around and play with packets!

- Just a reminder: this isnâ€™t a how-to guide for hacking WoW. I wonâ€™t be sharing any sensitive code or game-breaking exploits. So, no need to worry about any unintended consequences!

## ðŸ“¦ Packets 

Alright, weâ€™ve got our hook and `CDataStore` structure set up. Hereâ€™s the code weâ€™ll be working with:

```cpp
struct CDataStore
{
    uint64_t* VTable;
    uint8_t* Buffer;
    unsigned int m_base; // 0x10
    int m_alloc;         // 0x14
    unsigned int Length;
    unsigned int m_read; // 0x1C

    CDataStore(unsigned int size)
    {
        VTable = Offset::CDataStore_VTable;
        Buffer = new uint8_t[size];
        m_base = 0;
        m_alloc = 0x100;
        Length = size;
        m_read = 0x10;
    }

    ~CDataStore()
    {
        delete[] Buffer;
        Buffer = nullptr;
    }

    ByteBuffer ToByteBuffer() const {
        ByteBuffer byteBuffer;
        byteBuffer.append(Buffer, Length);
        return byteBuffer;
    }
};
```

Now, we know all the juicy info we need is stored in ByteBuffer, specifically Buffer = new uint8_t[size];.

Our goal is to pass each packet to an external process (in C#) where the user can read, edit, and then send it back to the client. To accomplish this, weâ€™ll be using Pipes. If youâ€™re not familiar with them, check out this handy [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/pipes).

Since all the tasty information about the packet and its contents is stored in the Buffer, all we need to do is send that over the pipe!

## ðŸŽ¨ Design

![Chart](FlowChart.png)

Above is a rough flow chart that should hopefully give you a better visual of what is actually happening here. The Wow process is calling our hooked function (NetSend) where our code is placed, our code then writes the passed Bytebuffer onto a pipe that will later be read out from our C# process. The WoW server does of course send packets back down to the client, but that is not within the scope of this project!

```cpp
    DWORD bytesWritten;
    BOOL writeResult = WriteFile(
        hPipe,                      // Pipe handle
        CdataStore->Buffer,       // Message to write
        CdataStore->Length,         // Number of bytes to write
        &bytesWritten,              // Number of bytes written
        NULL                        // Not overlapped
    );


    if (!writeResult) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Failed to write to named pipe. Error code: " << GetLastError() << std::endl;
        MessageBox(0, L"Internal Snort error failed to Write to pipe -> " + GetLastError(), (LPCWSTR)"Y", MB_OK);
        DisconnectNamedPipe(hPipe);
        CloseHandle(hPipe);
        return 1;
    }
```

## ðŸ‘ƒ C# process (Snort) !

```C#
                using (MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream(buffer))
                {
                    // Create a BinaryReader to read from the MemoryStream
                    using (BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(memoryStream))
                    {
                        // Read a short value from the buffer
                        memoryStream.Position = 0x10; // Ensure the position is at the start
                        short opcode = reader.ReadInt16();
                        string name = "";

                        if (UseRetailOpcodes)
                        {
                            name = OPcodes.RetailOpcode.GetEnumName<OPcodes.CataOpcode.OpcodeClient>((uint)opcode);
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            name = OPcodes.CataOpcode.GetEnumName<OPcodes.CataOpcode.OpcodeClient>((uint)opcode);
                        }




                        string output = name; //string.Format("Opcode => 0x{0:X4}\n", opcode);
                        output += $" ({opcode.ToString("X4")})";
                        RadListDataItem NewPacket = new RadListDataItem();
                        NewPacket.Tag = PacketCount;
                        NewPacket.Text = output;
                        BlackListed = BlackListOpcodes.Contains(opcode);
                        if (!BlackListed)
                        {
                            Invoke((Action)(() => radListControl1.Items.Add(NewPacket)));
                            CMSG_PACKETs.Add(new CMSG_PACKET(opcode, buffer, bytesRead, name));
                        }


                        if (CatchOpcodes.Contains(opcode))
                        {
                            CurrentPkt = new CMSG_PACKET(opcode, buffer, bytesRead, name, true);
                            PopPacketView();
                            HoldCurrnetPkt = true;
                            while (HoldCurrnetPkt)
                            {
                                Thread.Sleep(100);
                            }
                            buffer = CurrentPkt.Buffer;  // Taking what the user had a chance to change;
                        }

                        if (DropOpcodes.Contains(opcode))
                        {
                            buffer.DefaultIfEmpty();
                            bytesRead = 1;
                        }

                    }
                }


                PipeClient.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead); /// hopefully this doesnt blow shit up

                if (!BlackListed)
                    PacketCount++;

                Thread.Sleep(10);
            }
```
